# SchoolProject-Java-ATM
This school project for my Java Programming 2 aims to simulate a public ATM machine. 
For the interface, I used JavaFX and scene builder to create the GUI. I also used CSV to have an external files that stores the all the transactions.
Future enhance such as adding a deposit transaction is most likely to happen in the future.
